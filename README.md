# Project-1-Checkers

// temporarily putting my pseudocode here because I am having trouble pushing my psuedocode in my JS file into this personal repo

// This is the layout for my pseudocode for the first stage of my project

// This will be a game of checkers based on the standard rules of play, kings included

/*----- constants -----*/
// main consideration is the board as a constant

/*----- state variables -----*/
// this will include turn variables and piece color variables, 
// also king type variables possibly and winner variable
// reminder that the variables are to be defined in the functions, mainly init

/*----- cached elements  -----*/
// this will have the elements required from the dom to get the board setup
// will most likely include board div layout

/*----- event listeners -----*/
// setup event listeners for board spots that the players select to move their pieces
// to, but only for the movable board spots. Can also use a guard for this if easier

/*----- functions -----*/
// init function that calls render
// render function that calls multiple sub types of render functions that are
// more modular, this will include things like render board, render message,
// render controls, and more. Will also need to setup the piece logic and 
// win conditions in here
